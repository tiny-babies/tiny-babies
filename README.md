### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# About Me
I am a honors student at the University of California Santa Barbara. I am in my third year of studying Computer Science where I devote myself to maintain a high GPA, but I also love to pick up creative side projects in my spare time to build my programming skills.
# My favorite projects:

# What I am currently working on:
Backend and Frontend web app development in a school, team-based project here: <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-w22/team03-w22-5pm-2>.  This project has made me learn how to use Github very proficiently, and has pushd me to learn more about Java, Javascript, Spring Boot, React and Storybook.  The team-based design of the project has also helped me learn how to work well with others with coding, knowing how to communicate well to be efficient with our pull requests and branches with helping each other out.
