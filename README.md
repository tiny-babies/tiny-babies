### Spotify Analysis App
If you are a Spotify user, I highly recommend you try it out! <https://nickjohnsonucsb.github.io/utune> It has been officially recognized by Spotify and it is free to use by all!
- Used Node.js and React with Spotifyâ€™s authentication workflow to ingest the Spotify Web API and display personalized account insights and analytics with responsive graphics.

### Generative Image Extention using state-of-the-art, Computer Vision, Machine Learning Model
- <https://github.com/tiny-babies/generative_image_extension>  
- This is a must see project I did for an Advanced Computer Vision Graduate Course I took at my university.
- Utilized a complicated ML model called DeepFill v2 to extend its capabilities to generate novel extentions of images.
